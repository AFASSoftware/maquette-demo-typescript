# maquette-demo-typescript
Small demonstration of using Maquette with Typescript

The Typescript code for this demonstration consists of two files:

- A simple text input component: [text-field.ts](src/text-field.ts)
- A 'main' script that uses this component: [script.ts](src/script.ts)

Every variable in the sample is strongly typed, no **any** objects are used.
